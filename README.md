## Description
This project aims to predict the recurrence of thyroid cancer using machine learning techniques. The prediction is based on a dataset containing various features related to patient medical history, and treatment details. The target variable for prediction is `Recurred`.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 383 samples and 17 features. Below are the features included in the dataset:
- Age
- Gender
- Smoking
- Smoking History
- Radiotherapy History
- Thyroid Function
- Physical Examination
- Adenopathy
- Types of Thyroid Cancer (Pathology)
- Focality
- Risk
- Tumor
- Lymph Nodes
- Cancer Metastasis
- Stage
- Treatment Response
- Recurred (Target Feature)

## Approach
The approach involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Selection
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

## Modeling
We use various machine learning algorithms to predict whether thyroid cancer will recur. The models include:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- XGB Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Hyperparameter for Best Model

## Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
